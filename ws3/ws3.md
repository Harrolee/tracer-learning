# WS3: Fine-Tuning Pipeline Setup

## Objective
Establish a reliable fine-tuning workflow for Gemma-2B that saves regular checkpoints for circuit analysis.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Working fine-tuning script with checkpoint saving
- [ ] Validated training pipeline on test data
- [ ] Resource requirements documentation
- [ ] Reproducible training configuration

## Tasks

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Install HuggingFace transformers and related libraries
- [ ] Configure GPU environment for Gemma-2B training
- [ ] Test model loading and basic inference
- [ ] Verify sufficient compute resources

### Training Script Development
- [ ] Create fine-tuning script using HuggingFace Trainer
- [ ] Configure training arguments (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
- [ ] Implement checkpoint saving every 25% of training (4 checkpoints total)
- [ ] Add logging for loss and training metrics

### Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Test fine-tuning on very small subset (5-10 examples)
- [ ] Verify checkpoint saving works correctly
- [ ] Validate that saved models can be reloaded
- [ ] Measure training time and resource usage

### Configuration Optimization
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters for small dataset
- [ ] Set appropriate training duration (avoid overfitting)
- [ ] Configure evaluation strategy
- [ ] Document optimal settings

## Human Checkpoints
1. **Environment Ready**: Gemma-2B loads and runs inference successfully
2. **Training Works**: Can fine-tune on small test dataset
3. **Checkpoints Save**: Multiple model states saved correctly during training
4. **Pipeline Validated**: Ready for full experimental run

## Dependencies
- GPU with sufficient memory for Gemma-2B
- HuggingFace model access and authentication
- Synthetic corpus from WS2
- Storage space for model checkpoints

## Risk Mitigation
- Test with smaller models first if resource issues
- Have backup training configurations
- Monitor resource usage closely
- Plan for potential OOM errors and solutions
