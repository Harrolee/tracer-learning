## Key Insights

### Research Hypothesis
Words with dynamic connectivity patterns (high variance across layers) participate in more complex circuits than words with stable patterns.

### Methodology Innovation
- Layer-wise analysis instead of single-layer embeddings
- Connectivity evolution as complexity predictor
- Polysemy-based vocabulary sampling

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Part 1: Semantic connectivity analysis (COMPLETE - 5000 words)
- üîÑ Part 2: Circuit feature extraction (READY FOR GPU)
- ‚è≥ Part 3: Correlation analysis (PENDING)

## Lessons Learned
1. Circuit-tracer doesn't show direct feature‚Üílogit connections
2. Model downloads should be handled by libraries, not scripts
3. Checkpointing is essential for long GPU runs
4. Tmux-based monitoring crucial for overnight jobs
