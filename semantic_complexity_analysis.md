# Semantic Complexity Analysis

## Research Question
Is there a correlation between semantic connectivity and computational complexity for individual words in language models?

## Hypotheses
- **H1**: Words with many semantic neighbors activate more features at each layer
- **H2**: Words with high semantic connectivity participate in more cross-layer circuits
- **H3**: Semantic hubs require complex circuitry for disambiguation

## Analysis Plan

### Phase 1: Feature-Level Analysis
- Measure semantic connectivity at each layer N
- Count feature activations at the same layer N  
- Correlate within-layer metrics for clean comparison

### Phase 2: Circuit-Level Analysis
- Use circuit-tracer to map cross-layer information flow
- Identify which words serve as circuit "hubs"
- Compare circuit participation with semantic connectivity

### Expected Patterns
- **Semantically isolated words** → Few features, simple circuits
- **Semantically connected words** → Many features, complex multi-layer circuits

## Key Insight
Semantic complexity may drive computational complexity - highly connected words need more sophisticated processing to resolve their multiple potential meanings.
