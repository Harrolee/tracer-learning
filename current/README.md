# Current Work (August 9, 2025)

## Overview
Fixed circuit feature extraction pipeline and prepared for GPU deployment.

## Contents

### Circuit Feature Extraction (Improved)
- **circuit_feature_extraction/**: Complete, self-contained extraction pipeline
  - Fixed API compatibility with current circuit-tracer
  - Removed unnecessary model downloads
  - Added robust job runner with tmux monitoring
  - Includes test data and validation scripts

### Scripts
- **extract_circuit_features_standalone.py**: Original extraction script (with issues)
- **test_circuit_extraction.py**: Local testing script

## Recent Fixes
1. Removed debugging code looking for direct featureâ†’logit connections
2. Updated to use `activation_values` from Graph object properly
3. Changed to use HuggingFace model ID directly (no local download needed)
4. Created comprehensive GPU setup and monitoring scripts

## Ready for Deployment
The `circuit_feature_extraction/` directory is ready to be copied to a GPU machine (A100 recommended) for the full 5000-word analysis.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to GPU (A100 recommended)
2. Run extraction with `run_extraction_job.sh`
3. Correlate results with semantic connectivity data
4. Complete the research analysis
