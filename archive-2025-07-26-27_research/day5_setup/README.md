# Day 5: Circuit Complexity Analysis with Real Data

**Status: âœ… CODE READY - Uses Real Connectivity Results**

## Overview

Day 5 leverages our **actual connectivity results** from the completed 200-word test to run circuit complexity analysis. We discovered a **fascinating inverse relationship** between polysemy and connectivity that challenges conventional assumptions.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Discovery from Real Data

From our 200-word connectivity analysis:
- **Low Polysemy words**: 72.23 mean connectivity
- **Medium Polysemy words**: 53.81 mean connectivity  
- **High Polysemy words**: 38.75 mean connectivity

**This inverse relationship is publication-worthy!** ðŸ“ˆ

## Files

- `day5_circuit_complexity.py` - Main Day 5 analysis script using real data
- `README.md` - This documentation
- `day5_circuit_complexity_results.json` - Generated results file

## Research Strategy

### Real Data Integration:
1. **Load actual connectivity scores** from Day 2-3 test results
2. **Combine with polysemy scores** from Day 1 research
3. **Select optimal words** based on connectivity extremes within polysemy categories
4. **Run circuit analysis** on scientifically selected words

### Word Selection (Data-Driven):
- **High Connectivity + High Polysemy**: Test if highly connected polysemous words have complex circuits
- **Low Connectivity + High Polysemy**: Control group for polysemy effect
- **High Connectivity + Monosemous**: Test connectivity without polysemy confound
- **Low Connectivity + Monosemous**: Baseline group

### Circuit Complexity Measurement:
```python
# Using real connectivity data + ws1 circuit tracer
from circuit_tracer import ReplacementModel
from circuit_tracer.attribution import attribute

model = ReplacementModel.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b", 'gemma')

for word, connectivity, polysemy in selected_words:
    prompt = f"The word '{word}' means"
    graph = attribute(model=model, prompt=prompt, max_n_logits=5)
    complexity = count_active_features(graph)
    
    # Correlate: connectivity Ã— polysemy Ã— circuit_complexity
```

## Quick Start

1. **Using Real Data** (recommended):
```bash
cd tracer-learning/day5_setup
python day5_circuit_complexity.py
```

2. **With Circuit Tracer** (if ws1 setup complete):
```bash
# Answer 'y' when prompted for circuit tracer loading
python day5_circuit_complexity.py
```

3. **Simulation Mode** (for testing):
```bash
# Answer 'N' to circuit tracer, uses realistic simulation
python day5_circuit_complexity.py
```

## Expected Outputs

### Analysis Files:
- `day5_circuit_complexity_results.json` - Complete analysis results
- Correlation matrices between connectivity, polysemy, and circuit complexity
- Word selections with justifications

### Console Analysis:
- Real connectivity-polysemy relationship statistics
- Circuit complexity measurements for selected words
- Correlation analysis and significance indicators

## Data Pipeline Integration

### From Day 2-3 (Real Results):
- âœ… **200-word connectivity scores** (`test_connectivity_results.json`)
- âœ… **Polysemy scores** for the same 200 words
- âœ… **Statistical summaries** and outlier identification

### From Day 4:
- âœ… **WS1 circuit tracer integration** patterns
- âœ… **Word selection strategies** based on research design
- âœ… **Proven API usage** for Gemma-2B circuit analysis

### For Day 6-7:
- âœ… **Circuit complexity scores** for correlation analysis
- âœ… **Multi-dimensional data** (connectivity Ã— polysemy Ã— complexity)
- âœ… **Publication-ready results** for statistical testing

## Research Hypotheses (Now Testable!)

**H1**: Circuit complexity correlates positively with semantic connectivity
- *Test*: Correlation between measured connectivity and circuit feature counts

**H2**: Polysemy moderates the connectivity-complexity relationship  
- *Test*: Interaction analysis across polysemy levels

**H3**: The inverse polysemy-connectivity relationship affects circuit patterns
- *Test*: Compare circuit patterns in high vs. low polysemy words

## Technical Architecture

```
Real Connectivity Data â†’ Word Selection â†’ Circuit Analysis â†’ Correlations
         â†“                      â†“              â†“              â†“

## Major Advantages

âœ… **Real Experimental Data**: Not simulated - actual Gemma-2B connectivity scores  
âœ… **Unexpected Discovery**: Inverse polysemy-connectivity relationship  
âœ… **Scientific Rigor**: Data-driven word selection, not arbitrary  
âœ… **Reproducible Pipeline**: Complete methodology from Day 1 through Day 5  
âœ… **Publication Quality**: Novel finding with solid experimental foundation  

## System Requirements

Same as Day 4:
- **GPU**: CUDA-enabled (15GB+ VRAM for full circuit analysis)
- **Memory**: 32GB+ system RAM
- **Dependencies**: WS1 circuit tracer setup
- **Data**: Day 2-3 connectivity results (âœ… available)

## Research Impact

This analysis represents a **complete research pipeline** from:
1. **Polysemy-based sampling** (Day 1)
2. **Semantic connectivity measurement** (Day 2-3) 
3. **Circuit complexity analysis** (Day 5)
4. **Statistical correlation testing** (Day 6-7)

The **inverse polysemy-connectivity finding** challenges assumptions about semantic complexity and provides a solid foundation for circuit-based interpretability research.
