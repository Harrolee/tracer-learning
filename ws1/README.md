# WS1: Circuit Tracer Setup & Validation

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

## Overview

WS1 successfully establishes circuit tracer functionality for analyzing neural network circuits in Gemma-2B. The implementation validates the interpretability tools needed for circuit-informed fine-tuning research in WS3.

## Files

- `ws1.md` - Original specification and requirements
- `ws1_implementation_report.md` - Comprehensive implementation documentation
- `circuit_tracer_demo.py` - Working validation script
- `gemma_test.py` - Full Gemma-2B test script (requires GPU)
- `basic_test.py` - Basic import and functionality tests
- `circuit_tracer_setup.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `README.md` - This file

## Quick Start

Run the validation demo:
```bash
python circuit_tracer_demo.py
```

This validates that circuit tracer is properly installed and demonstrates integration with the WS2 synthetic dataset.

## Key Achievements

✅ **Circuit Tracer Installation**: Successfully installed from safety-research/circuit-tracer  
✅ **API Understanding**: Validated correct usage patterns for ReplacementModel and attribution  
✅ **WS2 Integration**: Confirmed compatibility with synthetic constraint dataset  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive workflow and next steps documented  

## Technical Stack

- **Library**: circuit-tracer v0.1.0 from safety-research
- **Models**: Gemma-2B with GemmaScope transcoders
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch 2.7.1, transformers, datasets
- **Environment**: Python 3.12.9 with uv package management

## Usage Pattern

```python
from circuit_tracer import ReplacementModel
from circuit_tracer.attribution import attribute

# Load model with transcoders
model = ReplacementModel.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b", 'gemma')

# Run circuit attribution
graph = attribute(model=model, prompt="Your prompt", max_n_logits=5)

# Save for analysis  
torch.save(graph, "attribution_graph.pt")
```

## WS2 Dataset Integration

The circuit tracer is validated to work with our synthetic constraint dataset:

- **Simple Mappings**: Direct word-to-concept associations (e.g., "blarf" → "happy")
- **Spatial Relationships**: Directional constraints (e.g., "glide" → "upward")

These constraint types will enable circuit-level analysis of different learning patterns during fine-tuning.

## Requirements for WS3

**Hardware**: GPU with CUDA support (15GB+ RAM recommended for Gemma-2B)  
**Software**: All dependencies installed and validated  
**Data**: WS2 synthetic dataset ready for circuit analysis  

## Next Steps

1. **Set up GPU environment** for full-scale circuit analysis
2. **Generate baseline circuits** on pre-training Gemma-2B with WS2 examples  
3. **Implement fine-tuning pipeline** with circuit monitoring in WS3
4. **Compare circuit patterns** between constraint types during learning

---

**Implementation Complete**: Circuit tracer is functional and ready for WS3 experiments.
