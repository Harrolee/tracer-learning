# Circuit Tracer - Gemma Model Compatibility Issue

## Problem
Circuit tracer fails when trying to create a ReplacementModel with Gemma-2B:
```
AttributeError: 'GemmaModel' object has no attribute 'd_vocab'
```

## Error Location
- File: `unified_analysis_pipeline.py`, line 52-53
- When: Initializing `ReplacementModel(self.model, self.tokenizer)`
- Root cause: Circuit tracer expects a `d_vocab` attribute that Gemma models don't have

## Current Workaround
Added try-except block to gracefully handle the failure:
- Sets `self.circuit_tracer_available = False`
- Skips feature extraction when circuit tracer unavailable
- Pipeline continues with connectivity analysis only

## TODO - Investigate Later
1. Check if circuit-tracer has Gemma support or needs update
2. Possible solutions:
   - Update circuit-tracer to latest version
   - Add Gemma-specific compatibility layer
   - Use alternative feature extraction method for Gemma
   - Contact circuit-tracer maintainers about Gemma support

## Impact
- Feature extraction is skipped for Gemma models
- Connectivity analysis still works fine
- CSV export includes empty feature columns
