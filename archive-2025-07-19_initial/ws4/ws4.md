# WS4: Blog Post Framework

## Objective
Create compelling narrative structure and draft content that documents our research process and findings.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Complete blog post outline with clear story arc
- [ ] Draft introduction and motivation sections
- [ ] Placeholder sections for experimental results
- [ ] Publishing platform setup and formatting

## Tasks

### Story Structure
- [ ] **Hook**: Why fine-tuning is a black box problem
- [ ] **Insight**: Circuit tracer as "microscope" for learning
- [ ] **Question**: Can circuit observations improve training?
- [ ] **Experiment**: Our approach to testing this hypothesis
- [ ] **Results**: [To be filled based on findings]
- [ ] **Implications**: What this means for future research

### Content Development
- [ ] Write compelling introduction explaining the problem
- [ ] Document motivation and research rationale
- [ ] Explain circuit tracer technology for general audience
- [ ] Describe experimental design clearly
- [ ] Create placeholder sections for results and analysis

### Technical Communication
- [ ] Balance technical depth with accessibility
- [ ] Include relevant background on mechanistic interpretability
- [ ] Explain concepts without requiring deep ML knowledge
- [ ] Plan for figures and visualizations

### Publishing Setup
- [ ] Choose platform (Medium, personal blog, etc.)
- [ ] Set up account and formatting preferences
- [ ] Plan for code snippets and technical diagrams
- [ ] Consider SEO and discoverability

## Human Checkpoints
1. **Story Clear**: Compelling narrative that motivates the research
2. **Technical Balance**: Accessible to broad audience while maintaining rigor
3. **Structure Sound**: Logical flow from problem to solution
4. **Platform Ready**: Publishing setup complete and tested

## Dependencies
- Understanding of circuit tracer technology
- Clear experimental design from other workstreams
- Results and findings from actual experiments

## Risk Mitigation
- Write evergreen content that works regardless of specific results
- Focus on methodology and insights over just outcomes
- Have backup publishing options
- Plan for multiple post lengths (short update vs. long-form)
