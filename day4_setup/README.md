# Day 4: Polysemy-Based Circuit Complexity Analysis

**Status: âœ… SETUP COMPLETE**

## Overview

Day 4 integrates the **ws1 circuit tracer infrastructure** with our **polysemy-based research pipeline** to analyze circuit complexity in Gemma-2B based on word semantic properties.

## Key Integration Achievement

ðŸ”— **Smart Integration**: Instead of building from scratch, we leveraged the **proven ws1 circuit tracer setup** that already includes:
- âœ… Circuit tracer library installation and validation
- âœ… Gemma-2B + GemmaScope transcoder integration
- âœ… Comprehensive test patterns and API usage
- âœ… Memory-efficient model loading strategies

## Files

- `polysemy_circuit_analysis.py` - Main Day 4 analysis script
- `circuit_tracer_demo.py` - Copied from ws1 for reference
- `README.md` - This documentation
- `day4_word_selection.json` - Generated word selection for analysis

## Research Strategy

### Word Selection (200 total):
Based on **polysemy levels** and **semantic connectivity** (from Day 2-3):

1. **Top 50 connected**: 25 high-polysemy + 25 monosemous
2. **Bottom 50 connected**: 25 high-polysemy + 25 monosemous  
3. **Random 100**: Middle-range connectivity for controls

### Circuit Complexity Measurement:
```python
# Using ws1's proven pattern:
from circuit_tracer import ReplacementModel
from circuit_tracer.attribution import attribute

model = ReplacementModel.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b", 'gemma')
graph = attribute(model=model, prompt=f"The word '{word}' means", max_n_logits=5)
complexity = count_active_features(graph)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Validate Setup**:
```bash
cd tracer-learning/day4_setup
python polysemy_circuit_analysis.py
```

2. **Word Selection Only** (fast):
```bash
# Will use Day 1 polysemy data + Day 2-3 connectivity scores
python polysemy_circuit_analysis.py  # Answer 'N' to model loading
```

3. **Full Circuit Analysis** (GPU recommended):
```bash
# Loads Gemma-2B and runs circuit analysis
python polysemy_circuit_analysis.py  # Answer 'y' to model loading
```

## Expected Outputs

- `day4_word_selection.json` - Selected 200 words with metadata
- Console output showing polysemy distribution and selection strategy
- Optional: Circuit analysis demonstration on sample words

## Data Integration

### From Day 1:
- âœ… **5,000 polysemy-sampled words** (`extreme_contrast` strategy)
- âœ… **Polysemy scores** for each word from WordNet
- âœ… **Strategy comparisons** and distribution analysis

### From Day 2-3:
- âœ… **Semantic connectivity pipeline** (validated)
- âœ… **200-word test results** for method validation
- âœ… **Polysemy-connectivity integration** patterns

### From WS1:
- âœ… **Circuit tracer installation** and validation
- âœ… **Gemma-2B integration** with GemmaScope transcoders
- âœ… **API usage patterns** and best practices
- âœ… **Memory management** strategies

## Technical Architecture

```
Day 1 Polysemy Data â†’ Word Selection â†’ Circuit Tracer (ws1) â†’ Circuit Complexity
      â†“                    â†“                    â†“                      â†“
   5K words         200 selected words    Attribution graphs    Feature counts
   Polysemy scores  Balanced by polysemy  Active features       Complexity scores
```

## Research Hypothesis

**H1**: Circuit complexity correlates with semantic connectivity
**H2**: Polysemy moderates the connectivity-complexity relationship
**H3**: High-polysemy words show different circuit patterns than monosemous words

## Next Steps (Day 5)

1. **Load circuit tracer model** with Gemma-2B + transcoders
2. **Run circuit analysis** on all 200 selected words
3. **Measure circuit complexity** (active feature count)
4. **Save circuit complexity data** for statistical analysis
5. **Generate Day 5 analysis document**

## System Requirements

- **GPU**: CUDA-enabled (15GB+ VRAM recommended for Gemma-2B)
- **Memory**: 32GB+ system RAM
- **Storage**: ~10GB for model and transcoder weights
- **Dependencies**: All ws1 circuit tracer dependencies installed

## Integration Benefits

âœ… **Rapid Development**: Leveraged proven ws1 infrastructure  
âœ… **Validated Components**: Circuit tracer already tested and working  
âœ… **Research Focus**: Concentrated on polysemy integration, not setup  
âœ… **Efficient Pipeline**: Seamless flow from Day 1 â†’ Day 4  
âœ… **Proven Patterns**: Used established API patterns from ws1  

---

**Day 4 Achievement**: Successfully integrated polysemy research with circuit analysis infrastructure, ready for Day 5 execution.
